# This null model looks at two species, that start out in thir respecitve ranges and then expand their range
# There is an effect of habitat quality on mortality
# This is the trsecondary null model
# There is migration in this model
# One species is choosy in its mate choice
# Density has an effect on migration probability
# This is simply testing for two ranges meeting with no difference between either species
